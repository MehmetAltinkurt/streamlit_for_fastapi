# Project Name: YOLO5 Image Segmentation

## Overview

This project leverages the power of YOLO5, a state-of-the-art pretrained model, for image segmentation. Using a combination of advanced tools and services, we have created a robust image processing pipeline to achieve stunning results.

## Technologies Used

- *YOLO5*: Our cornerstone is the YOLO5 model, renowned for its accuracy and efficiency in object detection and segmentation.

- *Pillow and OpenCV*: We've harnessed the capabilities of Pillow and OpenCV for sophisticated image operations. These libraries enable us to manipulate and enhance images with ease.

- *Dockerization*: The entire application is containerized using Docker. This allows for seamless deployment and consistent operation across different environments.

- *Local Deployment*: The application is run on a local server, ensuring a smooth and efficient development process.

- *NGROK for Internet Exposure*: We employ NGROK to expose our locally hosted application to the internet. This allows for remote access and easy sharing of results.

- *Streamlit.io*: To share our application, we've used Streamlit.io. This platform offers a seamless and interactive way to showcase our results and findings.

## Local Deployment

To run the application on your localhost, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Build the Docker container using the provided Dockerfile.
5. Run the Docker container to start the application locally.

## NGROK Setup

To expose your locally hosted application to the internet using NGROK, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for an NGROK account and obtain an authentication token.
2. Install NGROK on your local machine.
3. Run the NGROK command with the authentication token to create a public URL for your local server.

## Streamlit.io

To view and interact with the application, visit our Streamlit.io page. Here, you can experience the results of our image segmentation in an easy-to-use and engaging format.


Feel free to explore the code and contribute to our project. We're excited to have you on board! ðŸš€
