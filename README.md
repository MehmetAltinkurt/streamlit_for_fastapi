# streamlit for fastapi

In this project I have used a pretrained model, YOLO5 for segmentation.

I used Pillow and OpenCV for image operations.

I dockerized the application and run in my localhost.

I used localhost as endpoint server and used NGROK to open my localhost to internet.

I also run the application on aws EC2 instance (free tier, t2.micro cpu), but it did not responded post requestes since the app needs heavy computational power.

Used streamlit.io to publish the app.
